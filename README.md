# Black-Friday-Sales-Analysis
##Abstract
We all eagerly wait for Black Friday sales and plan ahead in order to make most out of it. Similar is the objective of a retail outlet on Black Friday. They also aspire to bring the best out of this day. The major objective of a store is to maximize the revenue on this day, by selling off a large proportion of their unsold inventory. The main challenge to achieve this objective is “What optimal prices should the store set to capture demand that maximizes revenue?” The problem we solve would help the business to get the predicted Purchase amount (or Willingness to Pay) for each product for each user. They can use this then to set optimal prices on the product (using Multinomial Model for Price Optimization or others). So, when we find Black Friday Sales Analysis data on Kaggle, it highly motivated our team to work for this interesting real-world problem for ABC Retail Store.
